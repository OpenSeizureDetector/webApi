This repository contains the code for the OpenSeizureDetector data sharing system. It allows users to upload anonymised seizure and false alarm data to help build an open dataset for research and algorithm development.

Users wishing to access the anonymised database of user-contributed data should refer to the [Open Seizure Database](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/OpenSeizureDatabase).
